Early-career researchers have spent countless hours re-developing simple tools for neurophysiological data analysis. As yet, such tools aren't free or bundled into an easy-to-use comprehensible software package. Here, we amalgamated custom and flexible MATLAB functions developed to analyze (1) body mechanics,... We hope that this development will hasten prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining a scientific idea with minimal time spent on software development...
