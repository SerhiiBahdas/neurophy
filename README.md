Early-career researchers in neurophysiology have been facing a challenge of having to rebuild basic analysis tools over and over again. Unfortunately, these tools are not readily available for free, nor are they packaged in an easy-to-use software suite. To address this problem, we have combined various custom and flexible MATLAB functions that were created to analyze several aspects of neurophysiological data. These functions include (1) analyzing body mechanics, (2) modeling musculotendons, (3) assessing motor units, (4) conducting statistical analyses, (5) visualizing data, and (6) managing files. We believe that by developing this software suite, we can accelerate the prototyping, testing, analysis, and refinement of scientific ideas, while minimizing the time spent on software development.
